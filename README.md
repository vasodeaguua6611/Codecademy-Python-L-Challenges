# Codecademy Python 3 Course Solutions

This repo showcases my solutions to coding challenges and exercises from Codecademy's introduction to Python course. Each solution represents my personal understanding and approach to the problems presented.
The challenges in this repository are based on exercises from Codecademy. For more information about their courses, visit Codecademy.com or go to Acknowledgements and follow the link to the course.

Please note that the solutions shared here are my own work and are intended for educational and showcasing purposes. If you're currently enrolled in a Codecademy course, I REALLY suggest you to try solving the challenges by yourself.

## Course Topics

- Python Syntax
- Control Flow and Conditional Statements
- Functions and Lambda Expressions
- Lists, Dictionaries, and Sets
- Error Handling and Debugging

## Disclaimer

These solutions represent my personal work and understanding of the course material. If you're currently enrolled in Codecademy's Python course, I strongly encourage you to attempt the challenges independently before reviewing any solutions. First, my own solutions might be pretty bad as i am learning myself. Then this approach will maximize your learning experience and help develop your problem-solving skills.

## Acknowledgments

All exercises and projects are based on content from [Codecademy's Learn Python 3 course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). I am grateful for their excellent learning platform and curriculum.
