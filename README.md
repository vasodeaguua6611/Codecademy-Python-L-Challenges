# Codecademy-Python-L-Challenges

Codecademy's basic Python course's challenges

This repo showcases my solutions to coding challenges and exercises from Codecademy's introduction to Python course. Each solution represents my personal understanding and approach to the problems presented.

The challenges in this repository are based on exercises from Codecademy. For more information about their courses, visit Codecademy.com.

Please note that the solutions shared here are my own work and are intended for educational and showcasing purposes. If you're currently enrolled in a Codecademy course, I REALLY suggest you to try solving the challenges by yourself.
